<h2>Services I'm trying to build:</h2>

<h3>Product Service - Create and View Products: acts as Product Catalog</h3>
<h3>Order Service - Can Order Products</h3>
<h3>Inventory Service - Can check if product is in stock or not</h3>
<h3>Notification Service - Can send notifications, after order is placed</h3>
<h3>Order, Inventory and Notification Service can interact with each other</h3>
<h3>Synchronous and Asynchronous Communication</h3>
